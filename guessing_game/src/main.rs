/*
 * additional notes:
 * Rust is statically typed languange
 * const has global scobe unlike variables 
 * use unmutable var almost as if they are const inside sertain scope 
 * example : { let age = 25;} this lets variable act as const only inside this scope and can't be changed
 * const needs to be annotated example: {const THREE_SECONDS: u32 = 3;}
 * shadowing can be used as a step between mut and unmut var
 * example: {
 *     let x = 5; let x = x + 2; // this is called shadowing and is valid, x becomes 7
 *     x = x + 3; // this is not valid x is immutable
 *     { let x = x * 2; println!({x}) // value of x is now 14 }
 *     prinln!(x) // out of scope from previous shodowed version, x is still 7
 *     // shadowing also allows us to change types
 *     let spaces = "   "; let spaces = spaces.len(); // posssible
 *     let mut spaces = "   "; spaces = spaces.len(); // not posssible
 * }
 * tuples: // annotated types but can be different and fixed length
 * let tup: (i32, f64, u8, isize, char, string, bool) = (98_222, 3.5, b'A', 0xffffffff, 'ðŸ˜Ž', "Hello darkness", false);
 * let (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) = tup;
 * prinln!((a, b, c, d, e, f, g) === (tup.0, tup.1, tup.2 ,tup.3 ,tup.4 ,tup.5 ,tup.6)) // prints true
 * tuples: // fixed type and length
 * let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July","August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
 * let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 * let a = [3; 5]; //same as let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
 * access elements: let first = a[0];
