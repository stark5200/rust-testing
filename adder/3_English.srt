1
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,820
- So, your boy's name is what?
- Snot.

2
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,241
- You called the guy snot?
- Snotboogie, yeah.

3
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,953
"Snotboogie"? He like the name?

4
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,997
- What?
- Snotboogie.

5
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:45,296
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar Isaiah betts?

6
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,925
You know, he forgets his jacket...

7
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,388
So his nose starts running,
and some asshole,

8
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,974
instead of giving him a kleenex,
calls him "snot".

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,519
So, he's "snot" forever.

10
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,150
- Doesn't seem fair.
- Life just be that way, I guess.

11
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,239
So, who shot snot?

12
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,157
I ain't going in no court.

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,253
- Motherfucker ain't have to put no cap in him.
- Definitely not.

14
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:28,214
He coulda just whipped his ass,
like we always do.

15
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,132
- I agree.
- He gonna kill snot.

16
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,135
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

17
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,554
Kill a man over some bullshit.

18
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:42,144
I'm saying, every Friday night

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,938
in the alley behind the cut-rate,

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,439
we rolling bones.

21
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,733
All the boys from here, we roll till late.

22
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,485
Alley crap game, right?

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,487
And like every time,

24
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,490
snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

25
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,076
Play it out till the pot's deep.

26
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,953
Then he'd snatch and run.

27
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,956
Every time?

28
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,666
Couldn't help hisself.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,297
Let me understand you. Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

30
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,049
And every Friday night,
your pal snotboogie...

31
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,721
He'd wait till there was cash on the
ground, then grab the money and run away?

32
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,264
You let him do that?

33
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,391
We catch him and beat his ass.

34
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,874
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

35
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,230
I gotta ask you.

36
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,609
If every time snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,488
Why'd you even let him in the game?

38
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,614
What?

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,827
If snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

40
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:43,581
Got to. This america, man.

41
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,640
If you walk through the garden

42
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,810
you better watch your back

43
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,690
well, I beg your pardon

44
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,610
walk the straight and narrow track

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,614
if you walk with Jesus

46
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,283
he 7! Save your soul

47
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,663
you gotta keep the devil

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,292
down in the hole

49
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,879
all the angels sing

50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,132
about Jesus' mighty sword

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,844
and they shield you with their wings

52
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:44,183
keep you close to the lord

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,852
don't pay heed to temptation

54
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,732
for his hands are so cold

55
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,860
you gotta keep the devil

56
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,864
way down in the hole

57
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,417
Way down in the hole

58
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,337
way down in the hole

59
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,300
way down in the hole

60
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,011
way down in the hole

61
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,187
- Guess what he said.
- What?

62
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:35,484
- "Gotta let him play, this america."
- No fucking way. He give you the shooter?

63
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:38,654
Three newports and a grape nehi
he's grand juried. It's down, bunk.

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,823
Barksdale's in part 12, right?

65
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,616
Project murder, westside.

66
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,743
- Which one, now?
- Never mind.

67
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,205
- Let's sit in on it for a bit.
- Where you gonna be?

68
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,059
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

69
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,086
Don't answer no phones, bunk.

70
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,300
Is that your signature
on that photo array card?

71
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,010
Yes.

72
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,222
And your initials,
next to the photo? Yes.

73
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,978
Mr. Gant, do you see the man you
identified from that photo array card...

74
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,731
Sitting in the courtroom today?

75
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,078
He's right there.

76
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:32,708
For the record, the witness has identified
the defendant, d'Angelo barksdale.

77
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,420
- Your witness.
- Thank you.

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,090
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

79
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,010
Had you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

80
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,932
No, no.

81
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,435
No further questions, your honor.

82
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:56,774
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

83
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,277
State calls nakeisha lyles,
yourhonor

84
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,836
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

85
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,129
I do.

86
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,095
- Can you state your name, please?
- Nakeisha lyles.

87
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,056
- And are you employed?
- Yes, I am.

88
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,685
- And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
- I'm a security guard.

89
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:37,481
And were you employed as a security guard
on may 4th, the day of the shooting?

90
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,358
Uh-huh.

91
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,112
- What were your duties on that date?
- I was in the booth of 221.

92
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,992
The guard booth in the lobby
of the fremont Avenue high-rise?

93
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,577
Yes.

94
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,330
Behind bulletproof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

95
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,249
- Yeah.
- Good.

96
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,337
Ms. Lyles, I know this may be difficult,
but can you tell us what you saw?

97
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,425
Erm, a man, he was
waiting for the elevator,

98
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,219
when another man just
starts beating on him...

99
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,431
And like, the one man,
he got knocked down...

100
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,726
- The victim?
- No, the man with the gun.

101
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,729
The man
who was knocked down had a gun.

102
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,025
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

103
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,032
Nope.

104
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,577
Excuse me?

105
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:35,748
He ain't here.

106
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,377
You don't...?

107
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,047
You testified.

108
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,428
Do you remember when detective
Barlow showed you this photo array?

109
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,096
Yeah.

110
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:55,809
Good. I call your attention to
your initials which identify this photo

111
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,646
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

112
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,358
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

113
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,614
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

114
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,783
But you identified him.

115
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,452
He looked like the boy that did it.

116
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,414
See, the one that did it, I saw him
come in the building a week later.

117
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,002
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

118
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,463
Right, a week later.

119
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,842
Hm. Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives

120
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:33,222
- you never said anything about...
- I tried. I called detective...

121
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:41,730
Erm... yeah, detective Barlow
on may 13th at 2pm.

122
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,651
- But he didn't call me back.
- Nicely done.

123
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,612
- You called detective Barlow?
- Yeah, twice.

124
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,824
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

125
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,079
- I need a price for pressure-treated.
- '$14.'

126
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,915
that's the price that
you were going to quote me?

127
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,712
Do you feel that, Mikey?
That is my fucking dick in your ear.

128
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,298
- 'Oh, that's nice.'
- Hang on, you fucking thief. What's up?

129
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,967
You been down the hall?

130
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,386
- What?
- Your case just hit the wall.

131
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,096
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

132
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,349
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

133
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,646
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

134
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,192
You use my car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch.

135
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,319
- Yo, ease up.
- You don't understand.

136
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,990
- I did it for that man and he do this.
- Getting heated ain't gonna help.

137
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,578
- 'Greggs, what's she saying?'
- It ain't what she says.

138
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,455
'Yeah? What do you say?'

139
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,499
I say we wait, shithead.

140
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,421
- That's him.
- All right, easy, girl.

141
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,382
- Yo, herc, you got that?
- 'Yeah, we see.'

142
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,675
are the uniforms on the horn?

143
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,760
'They're on hold.'

144
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,844
that's ghost.

145
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,596
All right, good, tiff.

146
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,389
Now tell me what I'm seeing.

147
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,850
- He gonna get little Mike.
- Then what?

148
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,852
Mike come back with the money.

149
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,774
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

150
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,942
I don't want no foot chase.

151
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,277
'Copy.

152
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,073
'Got it.'

153
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,368
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

154
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,622
Get the house on the left.

155
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,625
Get back. Get
on the ground. Get down.

156
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,253
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Get your hands up.

157
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,839
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker round the corner.

158
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,967
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

159
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,970
Drop them down. Get out of the car.

160
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,683
Get down right here, right here. Get down.

161
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,603
Passenger, put your hands
out of the window.

162
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,782
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open the door.

163
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,069
Slowly. Step out of the car.
Step out of the car!

164
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,947
- Down on the ground.
- Don't move.

165
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,031
Down on the ground.

166
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,912
That's it, take his ass to jail.

167
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,747
- You got him, carv?
- I got him.

168
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,086
- Look at this shit.
- Cross your legs.

169
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,132
Look at this.

170
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,386
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?!

171
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,848
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint!

172
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,017
- Stay in the car.
- Tell him to leave my car be!

173
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,937
- Stay in the fucking car.
- That shit just ain't right.

174
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
Whatcha doing with something like that?

175
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,525
What you got here?

176
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,779
Shoulda seen the way
this bitch was looking at me, kima.

177
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,782
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

178
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,201
Right?

179
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,214
Two guns, remember?

180
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,385
- Two?
- It's all good, kima, ease up.

181
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,478
All rise.

182
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,482
Part 12 of the circuit court
of Baltimore city is now in session.

183
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,526
Be seated.

184
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,488
Madame forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

185
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,660
As to the defendant
d'Angelo barksdale,

186
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,830
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

187
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,707
Not guilty.

188
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,669
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

189
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,798
- Not guilty.
- Yes! Whoo!

190
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,092
Be seated.

191
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,721
- It's you, daddy, yeah!
- Order.

192
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,015
- At least you made 'em work for it.
- Be seated.

193
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,811
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

194
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,107
Deputies will return
defendant barksdale to pre-trial

195
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,276
for processing prior to his release.

196
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,996
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

197
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,584
- You have a nice day.
- Yo, stringer, let's go.

198
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,052
Detective?

199
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,721
Detective?

200
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,225
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.

201
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,274
- What the hell happened out there?
- We lost.

202
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,194
- Were you on this?
- The case?

203
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,406
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from mclarney.

204
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,539
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

205
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,451
No reason.

206
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:51,248
You just like coming to court on murders
you don't work? For the thrill of it?

207
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,920
When you start coming with the customers,
it's time to get out of the business.

208
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,423
You shouldn't talk
dirty now you're a judge.

209
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,217
Now I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

210
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,929
That barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to avon barksdale.

211
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,308
- Who?
- Avon barksdale, stringer bell.

212
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,603
The crew that's been running
Franklin terrace.

213
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,188
Stringer bell?

214
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,359
In court with the legal pad and glasses,
scaring the shit out of every witness.

215
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,612
Him and his crew -
wee-bey, savino, stinkum.

216
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,866
- I saw them.
- You think about clearing the court?

217
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,244
On what basis? It's an open
court in a free nation of laws.

218
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,912
I thought it was Baltimore.

219
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,208
Barksdale has five out of seven

220
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,710
towers in the terrace.

221
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,795
That's ten stainnells in five high-rises,

222
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,589
going 24/7 for dope and coke.

223
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,507
That's just the towers.

224
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,010
The low-rises, corners, they're his too.

225
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,762
How do you know?

226
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,057
- Everybody knows.
- "Everybody"?

227
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,850
Everybody on the westside.

228
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,938
Barksdale and bell, they're the new power.

229
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,816
They've dropped
10 or 12 bodies in as many months.

230
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,694
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing.

231
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,197
- Who's working on them?
- In the department?

232
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,658
Nobody, really.

233
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,623
We're a little busy doing street rips.
Community policing and all that.

234
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,626
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?

235
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,546
Who said I did?

236
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,264
One more time. One more time.

237
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,518
Stop playing...

238
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,313
Fuck me.

239
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,652
You got submission numbers for the ecu?

240
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,362
- Nope.
- Get 'em.

241
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,574
- Why me?
- You want the collar, do the submissions.

242
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,828
- You giving me the start?
- It's your turn.

243
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,704
What's the extension for ecu?

244
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,707
Do I look like your bitch?

245
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,086
- We taking the Mercedes?
- No, I promised my girl.

246
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,171
Car's in her name.

247
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,423
Narcotics.

248
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,468
- Lieutenant. Line two.
- Here you go.

249
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,555
- Fuck me, I cannot type.
- Who the fuck can?

250
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,600
Millennium gone, and we still
fuck around with Smith corona.

251
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,396
We need them computers.
They promised to train us a year ago.

252
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,400
What would an ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

253
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,987
- Trade stocks and shit.
- Jerk off, you mean.

254
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,657
We get them computers hooked up,
herc'll be deep into some porn

255
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,161
and kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

256
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,163
- Gotta go upstairs.
- What's up?

257
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,914
Deputy's throwing some piss-fit.

258
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,084
- Major know?
- He's up there now.

259
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,380
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

260
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,966
Our major don't know what that tastes like?

261
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,219
It's the chain-of-command,
the shit rolls downhill.

262
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,015
- Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
- Piss does too, think about it.

263
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,852
- Shit rolls, piss trickles.
- Downhill, though.

264
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,562
You don't know that for sure...

265
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,356
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers,

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,359
- but why are there only two ecu numbers?
- Dope and guns.

267
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,778
Two guns, right?

268
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,364
- That's three.
- Fuck it, kima.

269
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,618
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

270
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,208
He means we are an effective deterrent
on the war on drugs

271
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,419
- when we are on the street.
- Fucking motherfuckers up.

272
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,671
- Indeed.
- Fuck the papenivork.

273
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,506
Collect bodies, split heads.

274
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,967
- Split them wide.
- The western district way.

275
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,596
- Aye.
- You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

276
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,809
Fighting the war on drugs,
one brutality case at a time.

277
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,354
Girl, you can't call this shit a war.

278
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,482
- Why not?
- Wars end.

279
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,113
You gonna write that down?

280
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,082
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

281
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,752
Smoke 'em if you got 'em because
this motherfucker is as ripe as they get.

282
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,214
- We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
- I know.

283
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,216
But you answered the fucking phone.

284
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,344
- Got to pay down my credit cards.
- Not off him.

285
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,265
- I leave you alone, what do you do?
- All right, I heard you.

286
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,225
Say the words, bunk.

287
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,352
- Come on, man.
- Speak to me.

288
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,814
So, you gonna cut and run on the bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

289
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,318
All right, then, this is my case. My file.

290
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,698
This shit comes back a murder, you ain't
gotta do shit but stand there and laugh.

291
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,157
You happy now, bitch?

292
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,327
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

293
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,538
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

294
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:45,333
This motherfucker probably came in
to take a shit and just fell out.

295
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,127
I bet there's nothing to it.

296
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,004
- You hope.
- Where you going?

297
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,091
Back to the office, where I belong.

298
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,391
You moldering motherfucker, don't even
think about coming back a murder.

299
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,893
Don't even think of that shit.

300
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,900
By tomorrow, lieutenant. Don't fail me.

301
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,535
Major's pissed.

302
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,289
He should be. He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

303
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,375
- About what?
- Avon barksdale.

304
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,002
Who?

305
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,923
- That's what I said.
- Who the fuck is avon barksdale?

306
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,885
According to the right honorable
judge phelan,

307
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,763
a westside player who indulges
in the occasional murder.

308
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,477
Now, as of today, I never heard of
Mr. Barksdale, but by tomorrow...

309
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,024
All right, what do we know?

310
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,693
The judge says
he has the westside high-rises.

311
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,445
The terrace, mostly.

312
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,990
- Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
- Maybe so.

313
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,497
- It's gotta be tonight?
- Major wants it filed by morning.

314
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,630
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

315
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:18,134
- What about homicide?
- Homicide major was in the meeting.

316
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,929
His people will be scrambling
to get something, too.

317
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,890
I doubt they'll be willing to share.

318
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,938
Barksdale, avon.

319
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,232
Got a dob?

320
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,249
- Jay.
- Where the fuck you been all day?

321
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:53,336
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

322
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,172
Ok. Just so you have an excuse.

323
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,217
But your fuck of a partner caught a call.

324
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,345
- Yeah, I saw him out there.
- Yeah, what'd he get?

325
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,932
- Decomp in a vacant apartment.
- Fuck.

326
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,935
Nolan's squad was up, that one's theirs.

327
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,312
It's a decomp.
It may come back a natural death.

328
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,441
- You think?
- In the poe homes, no fucking way.

329
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,569
Hold up. Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

330
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,322
- What about?
- Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

331
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,666
Sit the fuck down, detective.

332
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,419
Something wrong?

333
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,298
Put your ass in the chair.

334
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,606
You see these, mcnulty, you see them?
These are for you.

335
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,485
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

336
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,236
Major, what...?

337
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,866
Don't "major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.

338
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,119
What the fuck you doing
at the courthouse?

339
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,997
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

340
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,919
These are for you, mcnulty.

341
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,464
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking Irish ass.

342
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,300
And this bad boy is in your fucking eye.

343
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,471
I'm answering questions about
some project nigger I never heard of

344
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,556
who's beat my unit out of ten murders.

345
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,228
- Three. They only beat three in court.
- I got the deputy asking about ten.

346
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,356
No, they did ten,
we only charged them with three.

347
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,566
You're full of shit.

348
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,276
Sir, you can check the files.

349
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,405
Maurice scroggins,
toreen Boyd, Roland leggett.

350
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:48,785
The girl they found in the stainnell
in saratoga, collette something.

351
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,662
Major, these guys are real.

352
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,582
They beat me up on the Gerard bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

353
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,712
Scroggins? I don't have
an h-file on scroggins.

354
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,383
He was last year, summer. Two in
the back of the head, low-rise courtyard.

355
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,345
Let me understand something.

356
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,933
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

357
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,521
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

358
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,315
Major, I'm really sorry.

359
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,360
Phelan, he and I,
we... we go back a little.

360
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,738
He wanted to know about
the crew in his court...

361
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,574
I had to go upstairs

362
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:32,245
and explain to the deputy why he's getting
calls about murders that don't mean a shit.

363
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,164
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

364
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,251
He asks me a question and I answer it.

365
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,545
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

366
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,427
You have my attention, detective.

367
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,013
My complete, undivided attention.

368
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,186
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going?

369
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,356
- I'm eight to four.
- No.

370
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,692
- You're typing - sir? I

371
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,946
deputy wants a report on his desk at 0800.

372
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,700
- A report?
- Clean, no typos.

373
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,202
Make it look right, then put my name on it.

374
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,540
Do you want to reference all the murders
or should I soft-pedal that?

375
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,293
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?

376
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,795
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.

377
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:28,009
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

378
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,638
- Deputy likes dots.
- I'm sorry, major, really.

379
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:49,113
Niggers crazy in there, yo.
Eastside, westside, everybody beefing.

380
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,826
- You ain't got no problem, right?
- Hell no, we deep in there.

381
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,204
Mm.

382
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,414
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.

383
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,584
I didn't know what the fuck would happen.

384
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,171
I'm wondering how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

385
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,842
Slick what y'all did with that security
lady. That shit was tight, yo.

386
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,350
Let's walk.

387
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,784
- What's the rule?
- I know the rule.

388
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,455
- Say it.
- Don't talk in the car.

389
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,711
Or on the phone
or any place that ain't ours

390
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,422
or to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

391
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,090
It's your fucking truck.

392
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,719
Don't talk in the car.

393
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,325
My friends, yeah

394
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,622
feel it's their appointed duty

395
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,754
they keep trying to tell me...

396
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,130
What about Marcel?

397
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,468
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

398
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,804
- You want him out?
- I really don't give a shit what you do.

399
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,598
Actually, no.

400
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,350
Go down and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

401
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,519
The bum.

402
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,396
Oh, boy!

403
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,363
- How you doing?
- What's up, d? Good to see you.

404
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,033
What up, man? I ain't
seen you in a long time.

405
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,372
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

406
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,751
- Which one?
- White detective, black hair.

407
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,379
- The one that was knocking on all the doors.
- What about him?

408
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,758
He showed up in court to watch.

409
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,010
Word.

410
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,097
What are you talking to
that motherfucker for? Damn, d.

411
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,352
- He say anything?
- No, just sat in the back.

412
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,198
- What up?
- What you got?

413
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,992
- Huh?
- Come here, I got something for you.

414
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,259
- You must feel good.
- You know how that go.

415
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,929
- Say what?
- I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

416
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,931
I don't know shit about jail.

417
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,433
I don't plan on knowing shit
aboutjail, you feel me?

418
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,395
You wanna talk aboutjail,
go sit down next to Marcel.

419
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,731
- He just got home.
- True, you right.

420
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,109
Sit your ass down.

421
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,202
I know it ain't go good.
That nigger pooh, he caught me off guard.

422
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:26,122
- He came at me like he was crazy.
- So you shoot the motherfucker?

423
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,457
I'm saying, it was him or me.

424
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,334
You in our building.

425
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,881
You got people on both stairs,
more motherfucking people in the court.

426
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,678
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

427
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:45,308
How the fuck you shoot this nigger in front
of the security booth with them people around?

428
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,436
This nigger was coming at me
like he was trying to end me.

429
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,729
This ain't about him.

430
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,856
It's about you.

431
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,444
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating.

432
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,405
So the first thing you do,
you get all emotional.

433
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,617
You pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

434
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,702
That now we got to work around.

435
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,079
I know.

436
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,669
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

437
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,675
You right. You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

438
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,219
You say that all the time and you right.

439
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,640
But I'm saying though, I mean...

440
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,517
The shit y'all pulled
with that security lady.

441
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,730
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.

442
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,025
I ain't never seen a
white woman turn so red.

443
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,194
You should've been there.

444
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,197
Yo, man, you family, ok?

445
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:46,077
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

446
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,455
You gonna make that right?

447
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,582
Most def, you gonna see.

448
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,947
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

449
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,384
All right.

450
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:05,972
Come here.

451
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,642
Don't walk out of here like that.

452
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,560
You family, all right?

453
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,604
- You know it's always love.
- Yeah.

454
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,625
Type quieter.

455
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,753
You didn't have to wait up, love.

456
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,588
Your boy have a heart attack?

457
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:44,093
No, I went that way but doc Frazier
didn't bite when this popped up.

458
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,764
- You seriously fucked.
- Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

459
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,976
I did bad, bunk. It wasn't my fault.

460
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:53,811
Really.

461
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,440
Judge phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the barksdale kid go.

462
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,860
Him being ajudge and all,
I let go of some shit.

463
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,987
He raise a stink?

464
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,614
Major got busted by the deputy ops

465
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,700
and I gotta have a report by morning.

466
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,994
There you go, giving a fuck

467
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,455
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

468
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,716
Look at 'em, Cole.

469
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,386
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room

470
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,682
with two noble, selfless public servants?
I know I'm proud.

471
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,603
Tell me you put this one down.

472
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,816
Of course not. Of course your partner
has to go to the courthouse

473
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,444
and lay our business
out in front of a judge.

474
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,945
So you heard?

475
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:49,158
Major calls me, says I should get in early,
read over your shoulder.

476
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,456
It's got dots. Deputy loves dots.

477
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,500
Fuck you and your dots.

478
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,170
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

479
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,632
And the deputy's the fucking deputy.

480
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,011
And he, not the judge, has what's left
of your beshitted career in his hands.

481
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:13,015
He says so, you're walking foot
in the western tomorrow.

482
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:17,645
- Fuck it, I came from western.
- Where don't you want to go, asshole?

483
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,314
Evidence control? Personnel?

484
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,027
- Headquarter security?
- The boat.

485
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,071
The marine unit?

486
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,782
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me seasick.

487
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,201
That's good, keep it up.

488
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:36,122
I'll go this against 10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

489
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,544
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

490
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,853
Yo, stringer!

491
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,983
- You here early.
- Yeah, I'm on my game today.

492
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,611
- Eggy put out testers?
- Uh-huh. D...

493
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,740
New deal today.

494
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,161
You going out on point,
picking up business in the pit.

495
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,289
- What?
- You the man in the low-rises.

496
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,042
The low-rises? You
got Ronnie mo in the pit.

497
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,086
Ronnie mo got 851 this morning.

498
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:29,508
Why you put me in the low-rises?
I had a tower since summer.

499
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,302
Yeah, you had a tower.

500
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,432
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

501
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,267
This is fucked up.

502
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,562
You show us you can run the pit
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

503
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,692
My uncle know about this?

504
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,446
What do you think?

505
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,200
- Yo, bey.
- Yo.

506
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,620
Give little cousin here
a ride down the way.

507
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,140
- Have your people deal with Daniels.
- Right.

508
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,994
You gonna send your man mcnulty?
Tell him about chain-of-command.

509
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,497
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

510
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,243
- Yo, you looking for Ronnie mo, he uptown.
- I know.

511
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:23,998
You d, right?

512
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,669
- Wasn't you in the towers?
- Yeah.

513
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:32,432
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

514
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,469
I killed a nigger.

515
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,144
Last call on green top, last call.

516
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,855
Yeah?

517
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,274
Major?

518
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,610
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

519
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:57,531
- Lieutenant, I'm holding how many pages?
- Four, sir.

520
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,535
- Rawls had a fucking phone book.
- They got ten open murder files.

521
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,955
If we get ten shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

522
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,083
- I said that.
- They can't put him down for murder

523
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,378
- so they're getting us to do their work.
- Not getting us, they got us.

524
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,590
- They got you, in fact.
- Excuse me, sir?

525
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,843
Dawson has the York and cator case,
that leaves you.

526
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,513
Shit. Look, set something up
with homicide

527
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,307
and whoever you want from your squads.

528
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,268
- State's attorney?
- Yeah, we should call them, too.

529
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,397
Fucking shitstorm.

530
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,318
Lieutenant, line three.

531
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,071
Deputy ops.

532
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,207
Here we go.

533
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,043
Close that for me.

534
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,381
What's the coffee do?

535
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,675
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

536
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,513
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

537
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,181
All right, give me the real.

538
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,064
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

539
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,359
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here. Feel me?

540
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,946
I'm down.

541
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,411
You down? Johnny's down.

542
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,547
- You got that gig.
- Can I get a one-on-one?

543
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,090
Yo, poot.

544
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,022
Yo, Wallace.

545
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,446
This the way Ronnie mo set it up?

546
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,364
- Yeah.
- Man, this is fucked up.

547
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,911
You can't serve your customers
straight up after taking they money.

548
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,707
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

549
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:16,545
You get paid, you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

550
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,547
Then you serve. All right?

551
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,717
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more short cuts.

552
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,430
- What's your count?
- I'm up 270.

553
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,727
You want to count it.

554
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,063
I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

555
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,232
- But down here, you want to count it.
- Shit.

556
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,404
Hey, yo, yo, ho, ho, ho!

557
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,741
- Y'all niggers been burned.
- Huh?

558
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,244
"Huh"? That's what you got to say? "Huh"?

559
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,164
This look like money, motherfucker?

560
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,418
Money be green. Money feel like money.

561
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,214
- That shit look green to you?
- It got a dead fucking president on it.

562
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,633
I don't give a fuck about the president.

563
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,219
- That shit ain't money.
- He ain't no president.

564
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,097
- What you mean?
- Hamilton. He ain't no president.

565
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,599
Nigger, is you crazy?

566
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,020
No ugly-ass white man get his face
on legal tender except he president.

567
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,441
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?

568
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,652
You ain't even gonna be serving.

569
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,614
You be on the end of vine street,
sucking on a 40, yelling "five-0".

570
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,574
You hear me?

571
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,285
Get the fuck outta here.

572
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,331
That it?

573
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,691
You need to pace that shit, man.

574
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:06,488
- Johnny, man, you hear me?
- I'm cool.

575
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,366
No, man, you gonna fall out,

576
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,786
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

577
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,460
Man, I'm trying to give
you a little game, man...

578
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,088
But you want to pretend
like you know something.

579
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,009
I know a lot, bubs.

580
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,219
No, no, you... you green.

581
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,307
I'm trying to get you...
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

582
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,434
But you still green.

583
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,020
You gonna make me brown?

584
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,860
Yo, bubs?

585
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,071
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

586
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,200
Come on, man, I'm ready.

587
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,331
Yo, I'm brown.

588
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,378
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.

589
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,655
- Buy-busts.
- Yes, sir.

590
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:33,742
No long surveillances,
no kel recorders, no dnrs.

591
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,411
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

592
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,915
- That makes sense.
- Phelan isn'tjust ajudge,

593
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,292
he's a political entity.

594
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,754
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

595
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,256
Why is he asking about this barksdale?

596
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:53,345
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

597
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:56,848
- Lost a murder case.
- We lose cases all the time.

598
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,601
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

599
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,271
- Now, who you using?
- Lead detective?

600
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,274
- Greggs, she's my best right now.
- I know her?

601
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,945
Cid for four months.
Came over from eastern deu.

602
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,074
- Who's homicide sending?
- That's up to major rawls.

603
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,411
I wouldn't be surprised if you get mcnulty.

604
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,247
- You know mcnulty?
- Not really.

605
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,291
He mouthed off to the
judge in the first place.

606
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,461
- He talked to the judge?
- That's my understanding.

607
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,965
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

608
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,384
You need anything, you ask me.

609
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:35,345
I'll give you all the help I can.
But no surprises.

610
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,139
Yes, sir.

611
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,433
Keep me briefed.

612
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,495
- Hi, mcnulty, city homicide.
- Is anyone expecting you?

613
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,081
Yeah, special agent fitzhugh, squad five.

614
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,378
- He's expecting me, can I...?
- Not without an escort.

615
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,006
All right.

616
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,008
Agent fitzhugh to the front.

617
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,733
- Hey, Fitz.
- Hey, brother.

618
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,444
- She can spot a bad one.
- Nothing personal.

619
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,655
- You know how they are with security.
- I know how they are with locals.

620
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,700
- What's up, g-man?
- Good stuff, brother.

621
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,702
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

622
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,371
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

623
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,222
He's one of the better cl's I've worked.

624
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,876
- You up on a wire?
- That and more.

625
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:54,049
'So, like, he be talking like
he got some kind of record deal.'

626
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,427
- 'man, please.'
- 'That nigger.

627
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,765
- 'The pussy has you.'
- Jesus Christ.

628
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,893
- Pretty fucking great, huh?
- How'd you get this on tape?

629
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,104
That's not tape.
That's live, brother.

630
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,899
That's live?

631
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,069
Live from a three-story walk-up
on homer Avenue

632
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,779
in the bottoms of pimlico.

633
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,532
- This is going on right now?
- As we speak.

634
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,034
- How? _ fiber-optic lensing.

635
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:25,372
Camera's behind a hole in the wall. So
small it looks like a nail might've made it.

636
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,208
Where's the mic?
These fuckers sound great.

637
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,169
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

638
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,172
That's about 3k of raw on the table today.

639
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,259
- We followed it from New York.
- You're up in New York on this?

640
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,094
We could be.

641
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,596
We're backing into some
Dominicans up there.

642
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,461
We could have a title three
on 'em right now if we wanted.

643
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,768
Wrong war, brother.

644
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,437
Most of the squad's
gone to counterterrorism.

645
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,857
This is the last drug case pending.

646
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,025
I gotta shut it down by
the end of the month.

647
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,987
- You guys are getting out of drugs?
- Yeah, for a while.

648
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,531
We don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

649
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,199
Not since those towers fell.

650
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,327
We don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

651
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:09,291
- Joke's on us, huh?
- I guess so. Still...

652
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,003
You give great case.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

653
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,480
Got some tech nine over here.
Tech nine.

654
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,407
That's it, here's 20, hook it up.

655
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,368
Two and two.

656
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:46,786
- Hold up.
- What?

657
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,873
- Just two and two.
- Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

658
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,083
- I gave you 20, man.
- You gave me 20?

659
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,544
- One and a short three.
- So you get, two...

660
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:56,296
- Seven!
- Hold up.

661
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,591
- I get seven back. Come on, man.
- Calm down.

662
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,095
Hold up, hold up, you
fucking me up. Chill out.

663
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,267
You dropping shit on the ground?

664
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:11,811
- Hold up.
- I ain't got all day.

665
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,439
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.

666
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,485
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

667
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,487
- That's the motherfucker.
- Who?

668
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,365
The white boy right there.
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

669
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,784
The white boy.

670
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,911
- D, man!
- Hold up, man.

671
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,538
Hey!

672
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:40,465
Hey! Stop that white motherfucker.

673
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:44,302
Yeah, motherfucker,
yeah, nigger. Fuck that.

674
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,137
What are you doing, man?

675
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:47,806
Calm down, man.

676
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,975
Making me run, what is wrong with you?

677
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,978
- What, man, why you fucking with me?
- Shit.

678
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,355
This the motherfucker
with the make-believe money.

679
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,232
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

680
00:46:57,399 --> 00:47:00,110
- Wasn't me.
- Motherfucker.

681
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,405
It was this nigger, I
saw him. Get the fuck up.

682
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,284
- All right, listen, I'm sorry.
- Fuck that.

683
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,497
Motherfucker burned us for $30.
Take him to Franklin Avenue

684
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,791
and throw his ass onto
the motherfucking expressway.

685
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,587
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

686
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,924
- What you got on you?
- Just the 10 I dropped, man, the real one.

687
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,485
Well?! What's up?

688
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,954
Fuck it.

689
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,126
Hell, yeah.

690
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,802
We'll work out of narcotics,
with kima keeping the file.

691
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,472
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse.

692
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,390
Fine with us.

693
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:16,019
Mcnulty and santangelo will work
on the open murders.

694
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,898
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the terrace.

695
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,232
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

696
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:24,569
We put years over top of some
of these people, we'll roll a few.

697
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:29,157
You're not gonna get avon barksdale
or stringer bell on street rips.

698
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,534
- You don't know that.
- These guys are good.

699
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,746
They've got everyone running scared.

700
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,164
What do you suggest?

701
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,918
Surveillance teams,
dnrs, asset investigation.

702
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,920
Gather string till we find a way in.

703
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:45,131
Either a wired c! Or a title three.
That's what makes this case.

704
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:46,633
Is that what you told the judge?

705
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,929
Ok, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

706
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:55,892
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

707
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,103
- Then you don't do it at all.
- What the...?

708
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:02,273
You could've had this fight before
calling the state's attorney's office.

709
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:06,361
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about avon barksdale?

710
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,404
What do we know?

711
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,866
The guy's owned
all of Franklin terrace for a year.

712
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,994
What do we have on him right now?
A dob? A sheet?

713
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,163
A b of I photo?

714
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,958
We don't have a fucking photo of the guy.

715
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,668
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

716
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,754
Two days ago no one
on this fucking floor knew his name.

717
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,965
Now he's some criminal mastermind.

718
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:30,510
Shit, I say we go to the terrace
and fuck some people up.

719
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,390
You don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

720
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,559
When you know how
you're playing this, yell.

721
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,102
We know how we're playing it.

722
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,855
My people are going down
to do hand-to-hands.

723
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,317
Detectives mcnulty and santangelo
are going to review old murder files

724
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,528
and try to make a fresh prosecution.

725
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:53,241
I'll get us more manpower
but this case is not going to sprawl.

726
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,536
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our dayjobs.

727
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,122
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.

728
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:03,626
Anything on the murders, take to ilene
Nathan in violent crimes. I'll clue her in.

729
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,465
Anything else?

730
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,428
One last thing.

731
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:18,349
No one does anything on the street
without me knowing about it first.

732
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,228
Chain-of-command, detective.

733
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,190
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

734
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:34,032
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

735
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:38,620
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

736
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,122
You know, move it around,

737
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,500
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches.

738
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,963
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex, I still lose.

739
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,300
- You two can't talk this through?
- No.

740
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,096
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

741
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,559
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

742
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,437
- What about him?
- He's running this detail.

743
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:08,191
- Watch your ass then.
- He a snake?

744
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:12,070
No, he ain't that.
But he's a company man.

745
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,280
You know, a prospect.

746
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,492
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

747
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,369
Shortlist for major?

748
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:23,206
He's black, still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

749
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:26,084
- Shit, he even has a law degree.
- No shit.

750
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:30,588
- University of Baltimore, but still.
- He's gonna fuck this barksdale thing up.

751
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,841
- How's that?
- Buy-bust?

752
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,096
- He's pissing in the wind.
- You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

753
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,847
You made it happen.

754
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,144
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of bridge on the river kwai.

755
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,773
- What the fuck did I do?
- The bridge of what?

756
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,234
- You ain't seen that movie?
- Mm-mm.

757
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,237
I am fucked.

758
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,701
Fucked is me.

759
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:05,081
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

760
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,041
Two more.

761
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,256
Fits nice...

762
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:21,180
- It's all in the game.
- It was only a couple of dollars.

763
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,641
- It ain't the money.
- But we fucked him up bad.

764
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,768
It's the message, d.

765
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,230
You can't show no weakness.

766
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,400
- Still, I'm saying.
- What?

767
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,747
String. Yo, stringer!

768
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,053
Operate around the clock

769
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,805
why don't you come in?

770
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:09,771
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

771
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,900
- I ain't no John.
- Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

772
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,195
I'm not a regular, ok?

773
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:20,239
- I work for stringer.
- He pay you, don't he?

774
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,785
Come on, buy me a drink.

775
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,456
- How much?
- 20.

776
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,251
I drink slow.

777
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,758
Maybe another time.

778
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,734
- Buy me a drink, honey?
- How about you buy me a drink?

779
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,823
Carla. One here.

780
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,139
Hey.

781
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,599
- Where you at?
- Where you think?

782
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:35,231
- You late for work?
- A little.

783
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,862
- How much you got left?
- Girl, please.

784
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,366
- Ten pages and all the footnotes.
- When's it due?

785
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,952
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

786
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,418
Long night for you.

787
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,714
Long night for me.

788
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,722
I'll pick up some coffee.

789
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:20,026
So, I drive all the way
down to Liberty road

790
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,279
at two in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift.

791
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,532
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

792
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:30,578
To get a goddamn mouse out of my
wife's closet. Can you imagine that shit?

793
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,414
So what did you do?

794
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,544
What the fuck you think?
I got the mouse out and drove back to work.

795
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,630
Couldn't do nothing else.

796
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:45,426
Nadine out of her mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

797
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,430
She's up on the chair and shit
like some goddamn cartoon.

798
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,726
- How did you catch the mouse?
- Catch him? I lit his ass up.

799
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:59,982
- You shot the mouse? With your nine?
- Mm-hm.

800
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,902
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

801
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,946
Got him with the second.

802
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:13,663
What?

803
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,208
You shot a mouse with your service weapon?

804
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,626
Yeah.

805
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:23,047
- What'd you do with the carcass?
- I cleaned it up, you know.

806
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:27,134
I thought about leaving that little
motherfucker as a warning to others.

807
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,936
Fuck me.

808
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:45,152
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

809
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:49,282
Jimmy, man, I gotta change
my clothes at least, come on.

810
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,326
I'm gonna do this case.

811
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,372
What?

812
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,667
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

813
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,420
It's a buy-bust, get in and get out.

814
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,380
- Fuck that.
- Jimmy.

815
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,392
Let's call it a night.

816
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,126
Hi, bubs.

817
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:45,963
Thought you was still locked up.

818
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,424
Nope.

819
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,303
How long you been home?

820
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,181
It's been three months.

821
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,268
You don't write, you don't call.

822
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,606
Who's he?

823
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,942
A friend.

824
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,155
Is he gonna make it?

825
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,163
You still working drugs?

826
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,168
Downtown, yeah.

827
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,381
I got something for you.

828
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,104
- Last call!
- Ohh...! Fuck.

829
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,191
Found body. 200, block amity.

830
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,276
I'm a little thin today, boss.

831
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:53,614
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?

832
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,910
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.

833
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

834
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:05,710
I got it.

835
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,805
Jesus.

836
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,409
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Bunk, what's going on, man?

837
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,786
We got one or two shots to the head.

838
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,330
No witnesses, no suspects.

839
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,208
A .380 casing on the ground there.

840
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,169
Do me a favor, bag that for me.

841
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:54,091
- So, who called it in?
- No one. 21 post found him.

842
00:59:54,592 --> 01:00:00,723
It's a William gant, 42, no, 43
years old... er, address on schroeder.

843
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,808
- You got pictures?
- Yeah.

844
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,643
Ok, let's roll him.

845
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,528
'Mr. Gant, do you see the man you
identified sitting in the courtroom today?'

846
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,531
he's right there.
